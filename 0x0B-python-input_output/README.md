## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the ```with``` statement
- What is ```JSON```
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using ```python3``` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the ```PEP 8``` style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder ```tests```
- All your test files should be text files (extension: ```.txt```)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: ```python3 -m doctest ./tests/*```
- All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
- All your classes should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'```)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'``` and ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'```)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
